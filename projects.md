## Ares
Ares is my passion project, but I always have trouble explaining why. It's an RSS Reader, and it's awesome!\
I rewrite most of the app once a year, as an exercise in keeping up with new APIs apple releases. Sometimes it goes well, other times the APIs are so buggy one must put SwiftData to the side and use Realm - can you tell I've been burn?

## Rede
The trains in portugal are... special. There's really no way of knowing when they are arriving because the train stations were build in 1890, and the only update they got was in 1976 with the instalation of intercoms so people can cringe when the annoucer tries to tell the passengers their [train will be delayed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJkoChmVn98).\
My solution was to check the Infraestruturas de Portugal website, and use their open but undocumented API to create an application that has this information up-to-date.\
It was build in a weekend, and I'm not particularly proud of it, but I hope to make it better in the future.

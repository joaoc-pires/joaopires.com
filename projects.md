# Projects

I've worked in a lot of projects in the last few years, both iOS/iPadOS as well as other platforms. These might not the biggest of flashiest projects I've worked on, but are the ones I'm most proud of.

## Personal Projects
**[Ares](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ares-rss-reader/id1560552142)**: This is close to my heart. Not only is it my personal RSS Reader, but it's also the project I rewrite every year to learn new Apple API's and experiment with some less used technologies Apple might release.

**[Conceal](https://github.com/joaoc-pires/WoW-Conceal)**: Conceal is a small Addon for World of Warcraft. When blizzard released the new UI with Dragonflight, I wanted to start using as much of the retail UI as possible, but I also needed some functionality provided by ElvUI. Conceal simply hide parts of the UI when they are not needed. Simple as that.

      <article role="main" class="blog-post">
        <p>The Next Hundred Years, by George Friedman, is a book that tries to forecast the geopolitical landscape of the XXI century. I first read this book in 2011, after finding it at random in a bookstore. It’s the book that I attribute with my interest in geopolitics. I’ve kept in the back of my mind for over 10 years, and that I keep going back to when trying to understand the current state of the world.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I thought it would be interesting to review the forecast George Friedman made for second decade of this century, how it compares with the events of the last decade, and how the current trends we can see in the world compares with Dr Friedman’s predictions…</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I think it’s fair to say that no one can predict the future. The author argues, that regardless of the details, general trends can be observed, and that these trends guide the actions of competing nations in the global stage. Viewing nations as competing actors is a common interpretation by Realistic Authors on how nations act (or should act). From my point of view, I think it’s fair to categorize the author as a realistic, observing the world of international affairs as a zero-sum game<sup><a href="#bibliography">[1]</a></sup>. I don’t mean this as a judge of character or value, just as a definition of the lens through which I think the book is written.</p>

<p>The main point the author makes at the start of the book is that, at any given moment, the status quo of the world looks immutable and constant, that whatever changes come before, are now complete, and the current state of the world will seem to be constant going forward. This point, made extensively at the beginning of the book, and reenforced throughout, is one of its most poignant and that most affected me in the last 10 years. The examples given ring true: how many in 1900 could predict a long-lasting war in the next 20 years? Who in 1920 could have foreseen the German re-emergence amidst its economic chaos? How could anyone in 1940 say with any degree of confidence that the allies would win the war in Europe when France had fallen that same year in just 6 weeks? How could anyone not be preparing for world annihilation in 1960, when the two emerging super-powers were arming themselves to the teeth with a nuclear arsenal? Would anyone clamming, in 1980, that the Soviet Union would collapse, and Germany reunite in less that 20 years be taken seriously?</p>

<p>All these situations were of course foreseen by some, who could analyse the current status quo, and predict future outcome, but for most, it wasn’t so. This is the main argument the author uses to try to predict how current conflicts would end, and new conflicts develop.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I could see the logic in 2011, and more so now. Those were the days of the war on terror, of the never-ending conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan that dominated the news – the US lead western coalition was going to be in the middle east for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Not so much anymore.</p>

<h1 id="the-us-jihadist-war">The U.S.-Jihadist War</h1>
<p>The Global War on Terrorism is a U.S. lead offensive on terrorist organizations, both State sponsored and other wise. The author focuses mainly on the Jihadist conflict. The argument presented is that regardless of the political rhetoric of the conflict, the main goal of the U.S. was never to win a war, but to prevent an Islamic state from rising. Pointing out that the goal of the attack on the 11th of September was to kickstart the rise of a new caliphate that could threaten the U.S. hegemony, and the U.S. goal was never to nation build, or win anything for that matter, but rather to prevent any regional power from gaining enough momentum by destabilizing the region and prevent any eventual threat to the U.S. One could easily draw this conclusion in 2023, but I think it’s harder to have this foresight in 2009, the year the book was first published. I know I believed in the propaganda, and it’s hard not to – being bombarded by it every time the television is turned on. There were always detractors of the U.S. actions in the region, but the argument that the U.S. lead an invasion only for the Iraqi oil always seemed weird to me when the U.S. was already the 3rd largest producer of energy in the world. I’m not sure there was a cabinet meeting clearly defining these goals – and the author argues there probably wasn’t – but it does make a logical sense in the large scheme of things. Between the Afghanistan Invasion, the Iraqi Invasion, the Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War, the Yemeni Civil War and the second Emirate of Afghanistan, it’s hard to look at the region as anything other than unstable.</p>

<p>To the 1st point of the author, what in 2011 to me looked like the immutable state of things, is now but a footnote, in the same vein as the Mexican-American War – important, but not age defining.</p>

<h1 id="population-computers-and-culture-wars">Population, Computers, and Culture Wars</h1>
<p>In the 3rd chapter of the book, the author details what in his views are the some of the significant cultural strengths in the American society. It’s funny to realize that “culture wars” was already being used at the time as a term to describe the conflict between the social conservative right and the progressive left. The author however thinks the battle to maintain the status quo of the traditional family values is a lost one. The paradigm shift is tremendous and irreversible in favor of the progressive right.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to note that when the American Christian right is mentioned, it’s only in passing, but it is in association with the jihadists for having similar values. More emphasis however is given to outside forces pushing against the American progressivism than inside ones.</p>

<p>People have been warning about the extremist right wing politicians influencing American political institutions since at least the Reagan era<sup><a href="#bibliography">[2]</a></sup>. I’m unsure if failing to mention this influence was an editorial choice, a lack of imagination (as the author puts it, when failing to imagine the future that might be), or perhaps underestimating the impact this force might have in the U.S. and her allies.</p>

<p>Just last week French President Emmanuel Macron, when returning from a visit to China, stated that Europe should reduce its dependency from the U.S. and not be drawn into conflicts that are not hers<sup><a href="#bibliography">[3]</a></sup>. It’s also of note no European leaders have come out against Macron’s comments, and that President Xi Jinping mentioned he sees Europe as a power in a multi-polar world. It was hard to imagine these comments being made before the election of Donald Trump, a person supported by the evangelical right in the U.S. and apparently immune to scandals amongst his base, and who’s policies made U.S.’ allies wary of trusting its commitments in the international stage.</p>

<p>The chapter also goes into detail on what the author things are the cultural strengths the U.S. has when it comes to technological innovation – which I find fascinating, but a lean a bit too much in the exceptionalism part of American Exceptionalism.</p>

<h1 id="the-new-fault-lines">The New Fault Lines</h1>
<p>This chapter is where we can start to read what the author predicts will lead to conflicts in the XXI century. The pacific basin, Eurasia (read Russia), Europe, the Islamic world, and the Mexican-American relations. These are what the author calls fault lines, and it’s easy to see in 2023 four of these five fault lines already showing signs of stress. The Mexican-American relations is the hardest one to see from my perspective. This might be because of my lack of knowledge being European, because it simply hasn’t started yet, or because the author overestimated how much it could influence the decades ahead.</p>

<h6 id="the-pacific-basin"><em>The Pacific Basin</em></h6>
<p>It’s interesting to point out that the author could see in 2009 the possibility that internal pressure in the U.S. could lead to a policy change regarding trade with China, and could implement “protectionist legislation, backed up by its military strength.” This was written a whole decade before the American-Chinese Trade War started in 2018. The author also mentions how a nation who is facing economic disaster is more aggressive in finding new markets, which we can see happen in real time with China today.</p>

<h4 id="eurasia"><em>Eurasia</em></h4>
<p>In this context, the Eurasian Fault Line can simply be read as Russia. The author explains how Russia saw the end of the post-Soviet era with the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, and the revolution itself as an attempt to disintegrate Russia – and how it probably was to a degree. It’s a running thread in the book that one of the main strategies the U.S. has in Eurasia is to fragment it as a line of defense. A Realistic reading of this is: a weaker Russia is a stronger United States.</p>

<h4 id="europe"><em>Europe</em></h4>
<p>This is the section where the author is more uncertain about. Europe is not a unified state like the U.S. or China, but it’s also not completely fragmented like Latin American. One of the most unlikely scenarios, according to the author, is a Russia that is too aggressive that would drive Germany to look at it as a major threat and eastern nations like Poland and the Baltic states as under its sphere of influence. I think it’s easy to see the former, but the latter is still to present itself in any major way.</p>

<h4 id="the-muslim-world"><em>The Muslim World</em></h4>
<p>The author points out that the jihadist chapter is at a closer, I don’t think he saw the outro imposed by the Arab Spring and ISIS/ISIL, but it would be unfair not to give him praise for the assessment when the west as left Iraq and Afghanistan, and their problems are now seen as localized issues. It’s also of note that of all the Muslim nations, Turkey (or Türkiye) is the only the author sees as a rising power, on its way to reemerge as the dominant force in the region.</p>

<h4 id="mexico"><em>Mexico</em></h4>
<p>This is the most U.S. centric part of the book so far. It makes sense to have a book discussing the century ahead be focused on the U.S. as the major hegemonic power at the start of the XXI century, and all the issues discussed so far, no matter how regional they might be, affect the globe. The Mexican-American relations interaction with the world at large might only after the rest of the world in the sense that the author previews a good amount of power being lost or divided with Mexico. There’s a reason why the author puts this fault line at risk of stress in the end of the century, and not necessarily in the 2nd decade – which is what I want to focus this review on.</p>

<h1 id="china-2020">China 2020</h1>
<p>In the last decade, China has been building its navy rapidly. The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy) – yes, that’s its name – is the largest navy in the world when it comes to the number of ships. The number of ships however is not how to measure a navy’s power. The traditional measure is tonnage, and in that respect, China is still far behind the US, and even Russia<sup><a href="#bibliography">[4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The author mentions “China is not going to develop a naval capacity that can challenge the United States within a decade. It takes a long time to build a navy.” I find this quote extremely interesting, especially given that China already has 3 operational carriers. But in all honesty, I lack the knowhow to say if China, regardless of all the recent bullying, has a navy capable of challenging the U.S. The author goes on the mention the historical divisions between rural and coastal China, how outsiders impact the relationship between these 2 groups and the central state.</p>

<p>The main argument made is that the economic growth China has been experiencing is ending soon (in 2009) and in order to maintain internal cohesion China would need to follow one of three paths. In order of less likely to most likely is to continue its growth indefinitely, which no country has ever managed to achieve, a restructure of the central government and recentralization, or a third option would be for China to close itself to the outside world to prevent a fracture of the social fabric of the country. Although the author thinks the 3rd option to be the most likely, I would argue that the second was the one that already took place. Xi Jinping is a strong leader that manager to restructure and recentralize the Chinese government. Yes, growth is slowing, and there might even be an economic downturn in the Chinese future, but even with the recent protests triggered by the default of Evergrande<sup><a href="#bibliography">[5]</a></sup>, it’s hard to imagine China closing itself or even fracturing. If we add to this the recent blustering of the PLA Navy and President Xi about Taiwan, the Chinese affair is far from being a resolved issue in the XXI century.</p>

<h1 id="russia-2020">Russia 2020</h1>
<p>With all the recent chaos in eastern Europe, I think it’s necessary to contextualize the events between Russia and the west at the timing of this book’s publication. The author spends a good portion of the book in the rivalry between the U.S. and Russia, and of his predictions, this is the one that most landed closer to bullseye while at the same time furthest away. Let’s not forget that the book predates the military intervention in Syria, the annexation of Crimea, the proxy war in Donbas, and the current war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The author points out the problems facing Russia today – all well know, but still worthy to mention. The indefensible border, specially to the west, the encroachment of NATO, the population decline, internal ethnic divisions, and weakening economy. The author thought that the strength of the Russian army would be well stablished in 2015, that both Byelorussia and Ukraine would be completely under the Russian sphere of influence and that the conflict would be not with Ukraine but with the Balkan States. The fact that the Russian army is an empty shell is not something anyone 2 years ago would be any amount of money on, but that Russian would be stuck in a conflict in Ukraine, that NATO would expand directly into Finland (and Sweden, eventually) was unthinkable in 2009.
But the author was right, there is a land conflict involving Russia, but the U.S. is not the only other player backing Ukraine.</p>

<p>Not only did the invasion of Ukraine give new live and reason to exist to NATO, but it also brought the whole of Europe into agreement – something rather rare to see. The author, and Putin, I think is fair to say, also overestimated the dependency Europe had on Russian hydro carbonates. Europe is today taking the Ukraine conflict as an opportunity to heavily invest in green energy alternatives<sup><a href="#bibliography">[6]</a></sup>.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Revisiting this book has been a pleasure. It’s well written and concise, and although it’s sprinkled with American Exceptionalism at the early stages, it paints a picture of what the author thinks is yet to come.</p>

<p>Although I think his predictions for the Russian and Chinese situation failed in the outcome, being able to see them in the horizon is commendable, and in fact, I might be the one doing the misinterpretation of the current situation, with outcomes still to be seen. The fact that the Dr. Friedman thought that China could collapse, and that Russia would survive a new conflict with the west is neither an impossibility nor a certainty. What comes next is yet to be seen, but personally I wouldn’t be surprised if China and Europe emerge as new powers in a multipolar world, nor if Russia collapses due to the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

<p>That said, I am a European Unionist, so my bias is clear in that regard.</p>

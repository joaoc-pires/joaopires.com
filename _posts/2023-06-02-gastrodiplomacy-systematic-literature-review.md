Earlier this year I read a Vice article about why Thai food is so prevalent in the US<sup>[[1]](#Resources)</sup>. It was an intriguing proposition, that a government was trying to influence people outside of its borders using food. To me it sounded like it would be common sense and implausible at the same time. I needed to know more. 

At around this time, my partner was also getting ready to send the final review of his PhD dissertation, and I decided to try something novel. As an intellectual exercise, instead of spending hours going deep into the Wikipedia rabbit hole, I decided to try and write a scientific-like paper on the subject, to try to understand the state of the art on the matter.

I was promptly informed that I would want to write a Systematic Literature Review. Knowing very little on how to conduct such a review, and my partner having limited time to babysit me through the process, I did what a programmer does best – I Googled!
I found multiple videos on the matter<sup>[[2]](#resources)</sup><sup>[[3]](#resources)</sup> – and very useful channels as well<sup>[[4]](#resources)</sup>. To conduct my review, I used an adapted PRISMA 2020 flow, as well as Scopus and the Web of Science databases.

After spending some 2 months going back and forth with this project, I’m happy with the result. It may not be the best paper ever written, but the exercise showed me how to use the scientific method in a practical way. More details on the method can be read on the document itself, which can be found [here](https://joaopires.com/documents/Gastrodiplomacy-a_systematic_review_of_the_literature.pdf).

title: On the goals of the blog 
subtitle: This is why I write
---
It's always been weird to me why people keep blogs. Until very recently I just couldn't find a reason for it. In the last few months I've been on a journey of self improvement, and one thing that has kept me on track with my goals is to be accountable, publicly. Even if no one else cares, I care that I put out public that I have a goal, and this allows me to keep myself accountable.\
Besides that very specific goal, I also want to sharp my writting skills, and with this in mind, I'm embarking on a journey to document two significant aspects of my life: my consumption of various media forms and my exploration of Swift for iOS development. While these may seem like disparate topics, they both represent integral parts of my interests and endeavors.\
\
Through this blog, I aim to track my experiences with books, movies, and games while also delving into technical aspects of Swift programming.

## On Books, Games, and Movies
One of the core reasons I started this blog is to keep a record of the media that captivates me. Whether it's getting lost in the pages of a gripping novel, immersing myself in the cinematic world, or embarking on adventures in video games, each experience leaves an impression that I don't want to forget. By jotting down my thoughts and reflections on these moments, I'm not just creating a digital archive, but also gaining insights into what resonates with me most. It's like having a personal diary that I can revisit whenever I want to reminisce or analyze how my tastes evolve over time.\
\
But this blog is more than just a collection of my thoughts; it's a platform where I want to share these experiences with others. I believe that meaningful discussions about media can deepen our appreciation for it. Whether I'm dissecting the themes of a book, analyzing the cinematography of a movie, or critiquing the gameplay mechanics of a video game, I aim to offer perspectives that provoke thought and spark conversations. I hope to connect with fellow enthusiasts, creating a community where we can explore and celebrate our shared love for all forms of media.

## On Swift
Beyond my fascination with media, I'm deeply engrossed in the world of software development, especially in Swift for iOS. My blog serves as a platform where I document my technical experiments and discoveries in Swift programming. It's not just about recording my progress; it's a space where I share practical insights and tutorials that I hope will be helpful to other developers navigating the complexities of iOS development.

## Conclusion
In essence, my blog encapsulates the my goals of tracking media consumption, and exploring Swift for iOS development, and keeping myself accountable regarding my personal goal. I aim to create a place that reflects my passions.

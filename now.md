This page is my Now update hub, and I'll be giving it a refresh every now and then. 

## Work
On my day to day at [Cortado](https://www.cortado.com) I'm involved in the development of our iOS offering.\
I also give a hand to our [Thinprint](https://www.thinprint.com/) and [ezeep](https://www.ezeep.com) collegues with their macOS applications.

## Hobbies
Waiting patiently for Dragonglight Season 4 to come out.\
\
Been having a load of fun reading 'Boyslut' by Zachary Zane, which comes after devouring 'Identity Politics' by Francis Fukuyama.\
\
Still lingering over how fantastic 'Sea of Stars' is, and at the same time how I should've bought a Steam Deck instead of a Switch.\
\
Finishing version 3 of Ares, and already thinking about the refactor I need to do to Rede.

## Personal
Me and my husband just got back from our Easter vacations, and we enjoyed it so much we're considering options to move to the UK.\
\
Moving from Portugal is something we talked about for a while, but the destination was always the problem. It's now been decided.\
\
Meanwhile I'm trying not to get too ashamed that I fractured my big toe 4 minutes after getting out of the car when visiting the Peak District...\

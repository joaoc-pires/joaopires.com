### General
Reworked a lot of the sync engine. Apple's CloudKit is a little too opinionated, but I'm making it work.<br>
Fixed a couple of crashes, and some animation bugs.<br>
Added some other bugs that will reveal them selves in due time, I'm sure.<br>
Some UI elements were moved around to better accommodate the iPad.
<br>
<br>
### Sync
Added the option to turn iCloud Sync off - this will propagate to every device.<br>
Created a better system of duplicate removal and prevention.
<br>
<br>
### Feeds and Articles
Some very special feeds have specific behaviour inside the app.
<br>
<br>
### Sharing
It's now possible to share articles, feeds, and feed main pages.
<br>
<br>
### Themes
It's now possible to select a theme, other than the default pink.<br>
There's also new custom icons that go along the theme.<br>
Dark/Light mode can now be selected independently of system settings.
<br>
<br>
### What's new
This page is now visible in the app home page on 1st launch. After dismissal, it can be accessed again in settings.
<br>
<br>
### Other
This is not new, you're still awesome! =)

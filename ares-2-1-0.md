### General
Reworked a lot of the sync engine. Apple's CloudKit is a little too opinionated, but I'm making it work.
Fixed a couple of crashes, and some animation bugs.
Added some other bugs that will reveal them selves in due time, I'm sure.
Some UI elements were moved around to better accommodate the iPad.

### Sync
Added the option to turn iCloud Sync off - this will propagate to every device.
Created a better system of duplicate removal and prevention.

### Feeds and Articles
Some very special feeds have specific behaviour inside the app.

### Sharing
It's now possible to share articles, feeds, and feed main pages.

### Themes
It's now possible to select a theme, other than the default pink.
There's also new custom icons that go along the theme.
Dark/Light mode can now be selected independently of system settings.

### What's new
This page is now visible in the app home page on 1st launch. After dismissal, it can be accessed again in settings.

### Other
This is now new, you're still awesome! =)

Hello there, my name is Jo√£o Carlos!

I'm an iOS developer (both freelance and in-house), developing mobile apps for iPhone and iPad for 7 years.

I've contributed or published around 15 apps in the App Store, ranging from government agencies and banks, to personal projects.

At any moment you might find me reading the latest API documentation from Apple, an intro book on [economics](https://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/), the latest issue of [Heartstopper](https://tapas.io/episode/428109), or watching the new [Rouroni Kenshin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rurouni_Kenshin_(2023_TV_series)) TV Series.

My new quest is to complete an undergraduate programe in [Foreign Relations at ULisboa's ISCSP](https://www.iscsp.ulisboa.pt/pt/cursos/oferta-graduada/licenciaturas/relacoes-internacionais).

What comes next is too far beyond the horizon, yet to be seen.

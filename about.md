# About

My name is JoÃ£o (Jay) Pires, and I'm an iOS developer with 8 years of experience, based in Lisbon, PortugalðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹\
\
I'm currently employed at [Cortado](https://www.cortado.com), but I also do some freelance work on the side. If you're interested you can contact me through [email](mailto:developer@joaopires.com).\
\
You can find some of my personal projects in [here](https://joaopires.com/projects).\
Besides iOS Development, I also like to swim in the mirky waters of addon development for World of Warcraft.
